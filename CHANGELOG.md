## Unreleased

(Nothing yet)


## Release 0.18.0 -- 2025-02-03

* Fixed clippy lints in generated code (PR #143).  Thanks @vbrandl!
* Added a clearer "Getting started" section in the docs (PR #145).
  Thanks @j-n-f for the suggestion.
* Fixed some clippy lints in ructe itself.
* Updated `itertools` depenendency to 0.14.0.
* Updated optional `rsass` dependency to 0.29.0.
* Removed historic `mime02` feature and `iron` and `nickel` examples.
* Updated axum in example to 0.8.1.
* MSRV is now 1.63.0.


## Release 0.17.2 -- 2024-06-30

* The main branch in git is now `main` rather than `master`.
* Update clippy lint usage to get rid of warnings in all code using
  ructe (PR #137).  Thanks @vbradl!
* Identified a problem with `Content` parameters sent through
  intermediate templates, and documented a workaround for it (Issue
  #134, PR #141).  Thanks @drehren and @kornelski.
* The `axum` test is mentioned in [`README.md`] (PR #138).
  Thanks @abd0-omar!
* Update `base64` to 0.22.1 and `itertools` dependency to 0.13.0.
* MSRV is now 1.61.0.


## Release 0.17.0 -- 2023-07-22

* Added a check that no more than one of the http-types, mime02, or
  mime03 features are enabled (PR #124).  Thanks @rustafarian-dev.
* Changed the writer type from `W: &mut Write` to just `W: Write` (PR #125).
  Thanks @kornelski!
* Fixed handling of `MULTI_WORD_CONSTANTS` in templates (Issue #129, PR #130).
  Thanks @wezm!
* More ways to create a working rust symbol name from a "strange"
  static file name.  Illegal characters are replaced by `_`, and if
  the file name starts with a number it is prefixed with `n` (Issue
  #82, PR #132).  Thanks @Aedius for reporting!
* Fixed more clippy lints (PR #123, #127).  Thanks @vbrandl!
* Updated `rsass` to 0.28.0 and `itertools` to 0.11.0.


## Release 0.16.1 -- 2023-01-28

* Msrv is 1.58.1, so let ructe itself use rust edition 2021.
* Use format strings with inline captures (in ructe itself and
  generated code).


## Release 0.16.0 -- 2023-01-22

* Removed backwards compatible aliases for template functions.
  In ructe 0.7.2 and earlier, a template file `page.rs.html` resulted
  in a rust function `templates::page(...)`.
  In 0.7.2, that was changed to `templates::page_html(...)` and the
  old name was kept as a deprecated alias.
  However, since the template functions are usually defined within the
  same crate that defines them, the deprecation warning has usually
  not been shown, and this removal may still be a surprise to some
  users (it was even used in examples up to this change).
* Allow more lifetime arguments to templates in template arguments (PR
  #122, fixes #121). Thanks to @wezm!
* Added axum example (PR #118). Thanks to @vbrandl!
* Updated rsass to 0.27.0 and base64 to 0.21.0.
* Updated dependencies in examples: actix-web 4.2.1, axum 0.6.2,
  env_logger 0.10.0,
* Dropped support for rust edition 2015 in crates that directly uses
  ructe.


## Releaase 0.15.0

* Breaking change: Most methods of `StaticFiles` now supports method
  chaining, by returning `Result<&mut Self>`, making typical build scripts
  nicer (PR #115).
* Update (optional) rsass to 0.26 (PR #116).
* Some doc improvements.


## Release 0.14.2 - 2022-08-20

* Improve error reporting.  The debug output for `RucteError` is now the
  same as display, and the standard `Error::source` is implemented.
* Fix clippy lint clippy::get-first (PR #114).
* Update optional rsass to 0.25.0.

Thanks to @vbrandl for PR #114.


## Release 0.14.0 - 2022-02-06

* Breaking change: The generated template functions have a simpler
  signature.
* Allow litetimes in template argument types.  Issue #106, PR #110.
* Improve error handling in optional warp support, PR #109.
* Current stable rust is 1.57, MSRV is now 1.46.0.
* Update nom dependency to 7.1.0.
* Update optional rsass to 0.23.0.
* Update env_logger to 0.9 and gotham to 0.7.1 in examples
* Dropped support for warp 0.2 (the warp02 feature and example).

Thanks to @JojiiOfficial for reporting #106.


## Release 0.13.4 - 2021-06-25

* Allow `else if` after an `@if` block in templates. PR #104, fixes #81.

  This way we can also support more than one Content argument to the
  same template.
* PR #36 / Issue #35: Test and fix support for edition=2018.
