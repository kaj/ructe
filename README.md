# Rust Compiled Templates â€” ructe

This is my attempt at writing a HTML template system for Rust.
Some inspiration comes from the scala template system used in play 2,
as well as plain old jsp.

## Design criteria

* As many errors as possible should be caught at compile-time.
* A compiled binary should include all the template code it needs,
  no need to read template files at runtime.
* Compilation may take time, running should be fast.
* Writing templates should be almost as easy as writing html.
* The template language should be as expressive as possible.
* It should be possible to write templates for any text-like format,
  not only html.
* Any value that implements the `Display` trait should be outputable.
* By default, all values should be html-escaped.  There should be an
  easy but explicit way to output preformatted html.

## Current status

Ructes is in a rather early stage, but does work;
templates can be transpiled to rust functions, which are then compiled
and can be called from rust code.

### Template format

A template consists of three basic parts:
First a preamble of `use` statements, each prepended by an `@` sign.
Secondly a declaration of the parameters the template takes.
And third, the template body.

The full syntax is described [in the documentation](https://docs.rs/ructe/).
Some examples can be seen in
[examples/simple/templates](examples/simple/templates).
A template may look something like this:

```html
@use any::rust::Type;
@use super::statics::style_css;

@(name: &str, items: &[Type])

<html>
   <head>
     <title>@name</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/@style_css.name" type="text/css"/>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>@name</h1>
     <dl>
     @for item in items {
       <dt>@item.title()</dt>
       <dd>@item.description()</dd>
     }
     </dl>
   <body>
</html>
```

## How to use ructe

Ructe compiles your templates to rust code that should be compiled with
your other rust code, so it needs to be called before compiling,
as described [in the documentation](https://docs.rs/ructe/).
There are also [examples](examples),
both for ructe itself and its futures and for using it with the web
frameworks [axum](examples/axum), [actix-web](examples/actix), [gotham](examples/gotham),
[iron](examples/iron), [nickel](examples/nickel), [tide](examples/tide),
and [warp](examples/warp03).
There is also [a separate example of using ructe with warp and
diesel](https://github.com/kaj/warp-diesel-ructe-sample).
